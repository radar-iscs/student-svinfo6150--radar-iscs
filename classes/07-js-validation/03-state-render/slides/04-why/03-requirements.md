# What are you required to do?

This section of course does NOT require state-render
- Can select elements
   - Update their classes/text
- OR you can select ancestors
  - Replace chunks of HTML 
    - Including class names
- Both solutions used on jobs

Our unit 3 will use React which does this for you
- Easier to understand with early practice
