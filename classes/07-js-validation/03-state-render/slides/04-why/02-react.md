# A Particular Note

React is a fancy, easier, more efficient version
- We will define **components** 
  - These output chunks of HTML
  - That are replaced/changed 
  - Output is based on state changes
  - State changes when **events** happen
- We aren't using React YET
  - But we CAN use state-render without React
