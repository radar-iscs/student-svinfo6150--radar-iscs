# Destructuring

- Common: variables from object properties
  - Makes code easier to skim/read
  - May pass these variables to other functions

```js
const name = cat.name;
const age = cat.age;
```

- **Destructuring** (de-structure) does this
  - Can do to objects or arrays
  - Declares and assigns new variables
