# When you have the right element event

- Now know when the element we want was clicked
  - Filtered out event on other elements
- Can handle many such target elements!
  - Any descendant of the ancestor
  - That passes filter
- But we don't want to alter that element!
  - Ex: To modify `.card` div when button clicked
