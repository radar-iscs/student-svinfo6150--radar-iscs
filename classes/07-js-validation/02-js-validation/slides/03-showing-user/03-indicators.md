# Visual Indicators Cannot be JUST color

- Ex: Put red border around invalid fields
  - Requires they see and distinguish red
  - Not good for color-blind or vision-impaired
- Indicators + Messaging better
- For indicator styling
  - Place class on field(s) and/or on form 
  - Have CSS that selects for field

```css 
.invalid {  /* class on field */
  border: 1px solid red;
}
```
