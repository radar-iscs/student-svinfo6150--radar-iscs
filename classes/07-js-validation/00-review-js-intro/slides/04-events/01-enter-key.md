# Click events already work for keyboard

- I tried to make this very explicit:
   - I received no questions
   - You need to ask questions


```md
That click to make the menu "drop down" should be doable with 
keyboard navigation! (Tab to the menu option, Enter to click)
- Hints:
    - You do NOT need to add JS to handle the click - a 
    semantic clickable element like a button and a 'click' 
    event works just fine!
```
