# Very disappointing and disheartening

- I put a lot of effort to try and guide you
- I try to make expectations and requirements clear
- I warn that ChatGPT will hurt you while you learn
    - Great if you can verify
    - You're learning, you literally **can't verify**
    - It "works" isn't verifying
    - It is EASIER
        - Because you're not having to learn

I feel like most/all of my effort is going to waste

If anything is unclear, ASK QUESTIONS!
